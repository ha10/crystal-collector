I don't feel pressure in a negative way. I like pressure. I feel excitement and calm at the same time. No pressure, no diamonds. I want pressure: pressure creates drama, creates emotion.

Conor McGregor

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece. Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash. We don't care.

Lorde

I have a Rolex, but no diamonds. Rappers wear diamonds to compensate for a lack of fashion sense. I don't even have pierced ears - I'm not into that; it's too much. ASAP Rocky

Thomas Browne

Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust, like diamonds we are cut with our own dust.
John Webster

I buy so much fake jewelry, it's funny. It's not real. I don't wear real diamonds or anything.
Kate Spade

I'm a dirt person. I trust the dirt. I don't trust diamonds and gold.
Eartha Kitt

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby. Do you, do you, do you, do you. Know what you're doing, doing, to me.
Kaiser Chiefs
